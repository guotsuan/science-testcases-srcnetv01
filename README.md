# Science test cases SRCNet v0.1

This repository supports the development and coordination of **science test cases** for the SRCNet v0.1 test campaigns in the context of **Science Delivery** and is part of the [SP-5206 feature](https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-5206) (restricted access to collaborators).

Detailed documentation for each case can be found on this [splash page on SKAO confluence](https://confluence.skatelescope.org/x/nCAAEw) (restricted access to collaborators). 

## Purpose

- Defining user "science test cases" that will exercise real v0.1 functionality.
- Documenting hardware and software environment requirements for running science test cases, to assist operations.
- Designing and implementing computational science test cases.
- Selecting and potentially preparing datasets required for testing (SP-5158).

## Contributors

This work is led by the Teal team in collaboration with other Agile teams, and the Project Scientists, especially for defining test cases that reflect realistic scientific use.

## Structure

- `testcase_ID/` – individual science test cases corresponding to different science workflows
- `datasets/` – place holder for selected datasets
- `requirements.txt` – environment software
